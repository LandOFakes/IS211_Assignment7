Rules of the Game: Pig

The game is played with two players (this version only supports human players).
Players take turns rolling a single die until one of them reaches 100 points or more.
On a player's turn, they have two options:
Roll (r):
If the player rolls a 1, they lose all points accumulated in that turn and their turn ends.
If the player rolls a 2-6, the number is added to their turn total, and they can choose to roll again or hold.
Hold (h):
The turn total is added to the player's overall score, and their turn ends.
The game continues until one player reaches 100 points or more, at which point they win the game.
The program will display:
What was rolled.
The current turn total.
The player's total score before asking for the next move.
Game Controls

The game will automatically announce the winner when a player reaches 100 points!
